;;; Commentary:

;;; Description:

;; Completion support (`company-mode') backend for .indent.pro files.

;; Provides:

;; + meta information for command options
;; + annotation showing long options for short options and vice versa
;; + support for `company-doc' (ie ~C-h~ in company completion).

;;; Installation:

;; See [indentpro-mode](https://github.com/nverno/indentpro-mode) for
;; simple accompanying major mode.

;; Install `company-mode' and add this file to `load-path'.
;; Then either compile/create autoloads and load autoloads files,
;; or require the file in your init file:

;; ```lisp
;; (require 'company-indentpro-mode) ; or autoload

;; ;; Either set `indentpro-use-company' or add a custom hook,
;; ;; For example:
;; 
;; (add-hook 'indentpro-mode-hook
;;           #'(lambda ()
;;               (set (make-local-variable 'company-backends)
;;                    '((company-indentpro company-dabbrev-code)
;;                       company-dabbrev))))
;; ```
